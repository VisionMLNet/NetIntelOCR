<Tower:CELL-NYC-42> <connected-via> <Fiber:Link-NYC-42-01>
<Fiber:Link-NYC-42-01> <has-bandwidth> "10Gbps"
<Fiber:Link-NYC-42-01> <utilization> "85%"
```

**Intelligent Planning Queries:**

```
Query: "Find optimal location for new cell tower"

Semantic Analysis:
â†’ Coverage gap analysis across 50 square miles
â†’ 8 potential sites identified
â†’ Fiber availability: 3 sites with existing backhaul

<Asset:DB-Server-01> <protected-by> <Controls:[FW,IDS,WAF]>
<Vulnerability:CVE-2024-1234> <affects> <Router:CR-EDGE-01>
<Router:CR-EDGE-01> <exposes> <Service:Customer-Portal>
```

**Intelligent Security Queries:**

```
Query: "Show attack paths to critical databases"

Semantic Analysis:
â†’ 3 potential entry points identified
â†’ Path 1: Internet â†’ DMZ â†’ App Server â†’ Database
  Controls: Firewall, WAF, Network Segmentation
  Risk: Low (well-protected)
â†’ Path 2: VPN â†’ Internal Network â†’ Database
  Controls: MFA, NAC
  Risk: Medium (insider threat vector)
â†’ Path 3: Partner Connection â†’ API â†’ Database
  Controls: API Gateway only

<Network:A-Production> <similar-to> <Network:B-Production>
<Pattern:Unpatched-Firewall> <found-in> <Customers:[A,B,C]>
```

**Cross-Customer Intelligence:**

```
Query: "Identify common security gaps across customers"

Semantic Analysis:
â†’ Pattern detected: 60% lack network segmentation
â†’ Common vulnerability: CVE-2024-5678 affects 8 customers
â†’ Best practice from Customer-D applicable to 12 others
â†’ Compliance gap: 15 customers need MFA for PCI
```

**MSSP Operational Benefits:**

<ThreatActor:APT28> <uses-technique> <TTPs:Spearphishing>
<Asset:EmailServer> <vulnerable-to> <TTPs:Spearphishing>
<Mitigation:EmailFilter> <blocks> <TTPs:Spearphishing>
<Asset:EmailServer> <protected-by> <Mitigation:EmailFilter>
```

**Contextual Threat Queries:**

```
Query: "Assess exposure to APT28 campaign"

Semantic Analysis:
â†’ 12 vulnerable assets identified
â†’ 8 assets have compensating controls
â†’ 4 assets require immediate patching
â†’ Attack likelihood: High (similar orgs targeted)
â†’ Recommended actions: Deploy 3 additional controls
```

## The Power of Semantic CMDB

### Beyond Traditional Documentation

Traditional documentation systems are static repositories. Semantic CMDBs are living, intelligent systems:

| Traditional CMDB | Semantic CMDB |
|------------------|---------------|
| Static records | Dynamic relationships |
| Manual updates | Self-discovering connections |
| Keyword search | Semantic queries |
| Isolated data | Integrated knowledge |
| Historical only | Predictive capabilities |

### Semantic Query Examples

#### Impact Analysis
```sparql
# What happens if this component fails?
SELECT ?affected_service ?impact_level WHERE {
  ?component failure_affects ?affected_service .
  ?affected_service has_sla ?sla .
  ?sla criticality ?impact_level .
}
```

#### Compliance Verification
```sparql
# Are all critical assets properly protected?
SELECT ?asset ?missing_control WHERE {
  ?asset criticality "High" .
  ?requirement applies_to ?asset .
  NOT EXISTS { ?asset protected_by ?required_control }
}
```

#### Capacity Planning
```sparql
# Where will we hit capacity limits?
SELECT ?resource ?days_to_exhaustion WHERE {
  ?resource current_utilization ?current .
  ?resource growth_rate ?rate .
  ?resource maximum_capacity ?max .
  BIND((?max - ?current) / ?rate AS ?days_to_exhaustion)
  FILTER(?days_to_exhaustion < 180)
}
```
